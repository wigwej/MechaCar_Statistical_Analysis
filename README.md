Summary on deliverable 1 - Linera regression to predict influence on MPG

Vehicle_length and ground_clearance have very low p-values of 2.60e-12 and 5.21e-08 respectively. They are statistically significant as being < 0.05. It is a strong evifence against the null hypothesis and we reject the null hypothesis and would influence MPG. We accept the alternate hypothesis

Summary  on deliverable 2 -statistics of suspension coils

Lot 3 has a variance whic exceeds 100 pounds per square inch. At 1498.78, tire pressure is lower than it should be.

Of all three lots, Lot 3 has a mean of 1496.14, lower than 1500, while Lot 1& 2 have a mean of 1500.

Also, the variance and standard deviation for Lot 3 are extremely high. Lot 3 appears to have an outlier puling the data.


Summary on deliverable 3

LOT 3: It does appear that the sample is not from the population. It has a low p-value of 0.0416, which is below 0.05

At -2.0916, the te test has a value lower than it should. It is suggested that it does contain a couple of outliers.

Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition - Deliverable 4

In order to carry out a comparison of MechaCar against the cmpetition, I will use the two way ANOVA test. The reason is that AVOVA (analysis of variance) checks th means of 2 or more groups.

To adrees salient factos such as cost, higway fuek efficacy, horsepower mileage, safety, We will measure mean, medan, variance and standard deviation and compare them.

The null hypothesis H0 = MechaCar performs in same way as its competition. There is no difference in performance between MechaCar and its comepetition. WE would seek to determine the p value. If p < 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis.
